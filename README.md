# Infusion

Infusion is scripting and automation tool for Ultima Online that focuses on

- easy and powerful scripting
- the best UI is the client itself - UI for the tool is distracting and has to be as simple as possible - command line
- flexibility and extensibility

Easy scripts authoring

- handling well common cases
- automate any task - make available all modern programing tools for the UO scripting
- making mistakes difficult
- easy learning - similar to Injection, discoverability - intellisense, so you can start even without documentation

Flexibility

- language even use completely different API or build completely different tool like mobile client, headless client, binding to AI (OpenAI)
- UI agnostic, another reason for a raw command line, by default a decent C# editor, you can build and script your own UI, it is maybe a handicap, but more efficient

Status

- very well tested with niche combo Sphere 0.99gz and client 3.0.6m, but I would love to extend it for more versions, waiting for demand
- alpha API, it means that it can and will change, after it matures enough, it will be extended only, never changed
- inefficient implementation, some parts overengeneered, some parts spaghetti
