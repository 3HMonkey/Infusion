Infusion is an Ultima Online assistant similar to Injection. Infusion focuses on powerful and easy scripting features.
You can write scripts in C# using either built in code editor that has source code highlighting, auto-complete and
[REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) (Read Eval Print Loop) which
makes getting started with script authoring much easier.

If you are not familiar with programming you can start using example scripts which covers many repetitive task in the game.
They are designed to be easy to use and they guide you through a configuration process. You don't need to change any
script file to start using them.

You can use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/cs/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community) or
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you are a skilled developer and enjoy their excellent refactoring and
debugging capabilities.

## Getting Started

- Read [Getting Started](https://github.com/JakubLinhart/Infusion/wiki/Getting-started).
- Look at [example scripts](https://github.com/uoinfusion/Infusion/tree/master/ExampleScripts) with many explanatory comments.

## Current Status

Although you should be to connect to any server with encrypted protocol and use Infusion with any Third Dawn and LBR clients
We test it by active game play on a prehistoric Sphere Server 0.99za and with 3.0.6m client ([UOErebor](http://uoerebor.cz/vyveska) - Czech only).
We would like to extend support for other servers and clients if there is a demand for it.

Current status is alpha. It means that APIs are not stable yet and there may be some breaking changes. There can be many serious bugs and some critical functionality is still missing.

Please, create an issue if you find any bug, missing feature or server/client combination that doesn't work
for you.
